Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well?4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off\nSo we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5\nNow, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25,\n\n\ncan be marked off\nThere is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10\nWhere should we start marking off?In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3\nTherefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p,\n\n\nNow what should be the terminating loop condition?It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient\nDo you still remember Hint #3?Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off\nWhen the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n)\nFor the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia\npublic int countPrimes(int n) {boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n];for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {isPrime[i] = true;}// Loop's ending condition is i * i < n instead of i < sqrt(n)// to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt()\nfor (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {if (!isPrime[i]) continue;for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {isPrime[j] = false;}}int count = 0;for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {if (isPrime[i]) count++;}return count;}",

Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).\nHowever, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.\nBesides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.\nNote:\nYou may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.\nExample 1:\nInput: \"172.16.254.1\"\nOutput: \"IPv4\"\nExplanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return \"IPv4\".\nExample 2:\nInput: \"2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334\"\nOutput: \"IPv6\"\nExplanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return \"IPv6\".\nExample 3:\nInput: \"256.256.256.256\"\nOutput: \"Neither\"\nExplanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.\n"
